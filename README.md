Once Upon a fairy tale day a girl and a boy lay down on crisp emerald green 
grass, gazing up at a cool blue sky, misty clouds spread themselves out 
on the picturesque screne

"Pippy, What if something happens, like something bad?"

"What do you mean Oli? Nothing in the WHOLE WIDE WORLD can separate us, no 
force known to man (or fairies) will rip us apart!"

Oli sighed and said "Yeah, I guess so" but something inside him felt wrong 

Oli and Pippa were bestest of friends and as Pippa had stated nothing could 
tear Oli from Pippa or Pippa from Oli; or so they thought...

The sun was setting and they needed to go to bed.

"Race you!" oli shouted 

"You bet!" Pippa replied, they raced through the autumn woods down the pebbled 
lane and stopped at Fairy Walkway. Fairy Walkway got its name from its arc of 
woven ivy and trees that curl their curious branches around each other creating 
a patched and woven door way. In between the ivy and vines beautiful flowers grew: 
red ones, blue ones, lilac, sunny yellow, rosy pink and deep violet with midnght 
blue outer petals, some big flowers and some tiny, just as big as your little 
finger nail.

They entered the small hollow and said hello to all the fairies and pixies, 
the elfs sat in their own group, of course. (Elves are quite anti-social and 
quiet). All the fairies and pixies hovered over, their wings glinting in the 
twilight.

The fairies have slim and elegant bodies you feel you could almost snap them in 
half, they have beautiful faces that woudd take you breath away. Pixies are also 
quite good looking with strong, sturdy wings and muscular chests that shine if 
they catch the light, their faces are also very muscular, thay have strong, 
handsome features that can stop passing fairies in their tracks. Elves however 
are quite grumpy looking with a threatening scowl that is tattooed on their 
wrinkly faces. Even if elves are in a  relatively good mood
(which they rarely are) the tattoo doesn't wash off. This way the elves can be 
rather crafty, they can tell lies like none you have ever heard!
