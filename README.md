Once Upon a fairy tale day a girl and a boy lay down on crisp emerald green 
grass, gazing up at a cool blue sky, misty clouds spread themselves out 
on the picturesque screne

"Pippy, What if something happens, like something bad?"

"What do you mean Oli? _Nothing_ in the WHOLE WIDE WORLD can separate us, no 
force known to man (or fairies) will rip us apart!"

Oli sighed and said "Yeah, I guess so" but something inside him felt wrong 

Oli and Pippa were bestest of friends and as Pippa had stated nothing could 
tear Oli from Pippa or Pippa from Oli; or so they thought...

The sun was setting and they needed to go to bed.

"Race you!" oli shouted 

"You bet!" Pippa replied, they raced through the autumn woods down the pebbled 
lane and stopped at Fairy Walkway. Fairy Walkway got its name from its arc of 
woven ivy and trees that curl their curious branches around each other creating 
a patched and woven door way. In between the ivy and vines beautiful flowers grew: 
red ones, blue ones, lilac, sunny yellow, rosy pink and deep violet with midnght 
blue outer petals, some big flowers and some tiny, just as big as your little 
finger nail.

They entered the small hollow and said hello to all the fairies and pixies, 
the elfs sat in their own group, of course. (Elves are quite anti-social and 
quiet). All the fairies and pixies hovered over, their wings glinting in the 
twilight.

The fairies have slim and elegant bodies you feel you could almost snap them in 
half, they have beautiful faces that woudd take you breath away. Pixies are also 
quite good looking with strong, sturdy wings and muscular chests that shine if 
they catch the light, their faces are also very muscular, thay have strong, 
handsome features that can stop passing fairies in their tracks. Elves however 
are quite grumpy looking with a threatening scowl that is tattooed on their 
wrinkly faces. Even if elves are in a  relatively good mood
(which they rarely are) the tattoo doesn't wash off. This way the elves can be 
rather crafty, they can tell lies like none you have ever heard!

Darkness was almost falling and they needed to have some dinner. Dinner 
consisted of acorns, blackberries and maple sap for dessert. They gulped this 
down in two seconds flat, it had been a long and tiring day up on the hillside, 
near Ashwood Cove, no one ever went near Ashwood Cove, not even the ogres and 
trolls and not _even_ the big trimp-tackers: they were the biggest, fiercest, 
most dangerous creatures in the whole of the world!

Pippa scrambled into bed, which was in a hollow tree in two leaves sewn together 
with ivy vines to make a sleeping bag. The tree was cosy with a lamp lit by a 
little glow worm in a glass jam jar. 

"Night Pippi!" Oli called from his bed in teh same big old oak tree on a 
branch-bunk just above Pippa's hollow. 

"Night Oli!" Pippa called in response. 

Meanwhile, while Pippa nad oli were going to bed, people were waking up 
somewhere not so far away on another world completely. 
Lots of people lived there, normal people and a normal villag. The village 
people were always going about their jobs normally every single day. Some of 
the folks wanted something exciting to happen for once, but it never did. 

As I said, everything was normal, except one thing, well one person. A man and 
his wife lived by themselves: no baby, no child, no nothing. This was because 
they couldn't. So old John  spent his days searching and searching and searching 
everywhere. _All_ the orphanages, all the church doorsteps and asking around 
"has any body seen an abandoned girl?" They particularly wanted a girl so she 
could be beautiful and radiant and all the village to love her. she could swish 
her long glossy hair and it would ripple like a rushing river in the wind, or 
so they hoped. 

Ring, ring, ring! "Oh shhh" John croaked as he fell out of his rather 
dishevelled bed, went back to sleep for a minute on the floor and then realised 
what the time was. "Oh no, oh I need to get up quick!" he said "Mmm grrr hoor 
shooo" John's wife groaned. 

John's early morning work was searching. He searched and searched but after 
twelve years of searching the little village he had looked in all the church 
doorsteps and scanned all the nooks and crannies for a lost baby or a homeless 
girl (pretty of course); and all the orphanages. He checked them almost every 
day, in the evenings, just in case any body gave in their baby or found one. 

Today though he decided to go right into the village square, where the 
clocktower is. The clocktower was in the centre of the village both literally 
and in their hearts. the Tower was tall, very tall; it could almost touch the 
clouds! John gazed up at the top of the Tower, where the clock face is and then 
looked forward, in front of him. He saw some mini double doors! It looked like 
a trap door. He looked around, no one was up yet, it was very early. John went 
over and yanked one open. It was very difficult because moss had glued its soft 
pillowness into the gaps forming a very effective glue. Ivy crawled its evil 
vines around the door knob meaning it was extremely hard to turn, but he managed 
eventually.

Inside it was pitch black, but John always carried a lamp around so he lit the 
lamp and pulled the door but left it ajar. He looked right and he saw a 
staircase which he guessed was the extraordinarily long one that led right up to
the top of the Clocktower. then in front of him he saw another tiny trap door, 
yet it was a sort of circular door with an indented edge, just like a cog he 
thought. John tugged and pulled and yanked but the door _wasn't_ going anywhere. 
"Maybe it was locked?" but there was no key hole! "Maybe ivy and foliage blocked 
it from the other side, because ther certainly wasn't any on this side." thought 
John. So he kept on trying and trying until at _last_ with one tremendous tug 
he pulled the cog door open.
